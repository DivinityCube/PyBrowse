# PyBrowse
A simple browser written in Python which uses the QtWebEngine. Part of the PySuite group of apps. 

IMPORTANT - On 27th February 2025, a decision was made to end all future development of PyBrowse. However, since 0.3.1 is currently in development, it will be the last ever version of PyBrowse to release. After 0.3.1 is released, PyBrowse will no longer recieve feature updates and enter an EOL phase which will last until the EOL date when this repository will be taken down.

The reason for this upcoming EOL phase is because of a new, much more modern successor of PyBrowse I am working on called Atlas. Atlas utilises much more secure & featureful PyQt6 libraries instead of PyQt5 (which is what PyBrowse currently uses). Also, it will be much more convenient and less stressful than porting the entirety of PyBrowse's code to PyQt6. Atlas is still heavily in development but will likely reach an alpha phase by the time PyBrowse's EOL date arrives.

PyBrowse's EOL date is currently undecided due to 0.3.1's active development.
